Hi Hubot 
returns Hi Mitch.

This was a basic respond to see if my code was working and slack was responding.


2)

Joke time

I created an array of dad jokes and used a function to respond with a random joke from that array.


3)

Roll dice

I created 2 dice and have them randomly roll numbers. You will receive the amount of each number and the total of both numbers.
This could be a fun little game to play in the lobby where people roll dice. 

Although I haven't done more this this yet, the goal would be to save the data and eventually ask for a score.
Once the score is announced, a winner will be declared and the amounts reset.
