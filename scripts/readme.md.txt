Hi Hubot 
returns Hi Mitch.

This was a basic respond to see if my code was working and slack was responding.


2)

Joke time

I created an array of dad jokes and used a function to respond with a random joke from that array.


3)

Roll dice

5 Rolls per game.
2x random dice will roll (number between 1 & 6).
Gives a total score.
After 5 games, the highest score wins.
Game is reset ready to be played again.
